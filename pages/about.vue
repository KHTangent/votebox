		<h1>About VoteBox</h1>
		<p>
			This is a website for online polls, where every vote requires a unique
			link. It was written in less than three days, so expect bugs and errors.
			If you find any, please let me know (for example by email:
			<a href="mailto:contact@khtangent.com">contact@khtangent.com</a>). Full
			source code for the website can be found on
			<a href="https://github.com/KHTangent/votebox">my GitHub</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			The website was created mostly to try out the new
			<a href="https://v3.nuxtjs.org/">Nuxt 3</a>
			framework.
